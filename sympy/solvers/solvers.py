                    [(-2, -2), (0, 2), (0, 2), (2, -2)]

                Warning:
                If no symbols are given for a nonlinear system of equations or
                are given as a set, the solution tuples will contain values for
                the symbols as if the symbols had been sorted with sort_key. In
                the following examples, the solution for x appears first in the
                tuple:
                    >>> solve([x - 2, x**2 + y])
                    [(2, -4)]
                    >>> solve([x - 2, x**2 + f(x)], set([f(x), x]))
                    [(2, -4)]

                Presently, assumptions aren't checked when `solve()` input

            is in ``symbols`` (if given) and is not in ``exclude`` (if given).

        No simplification is done to ``f`` other than and mul=True expansion, so
        the solution will correspond strictly to a unique solution.

    Examples:

        >>> from sympy.solvers.solvers import solve_linear
        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z

    These are linear in x and 1/x:

        >>> solve_linear(x + y**2)
        (x, -y**2)
        >>> solve_linear(1/x - y**2)
        (x, y**(-2))

    When not linear in x or y then the numerator and denominator are returned.

        >>> solve_linear(x**2/y**2 - 3)
        (x**2 - 3*y**2, y**2)

    If x is allowed to cancel, then this appears linear, but this sort of
    cancellation is not done so the solution will always satisfy the original
    expression without causing a division by zero error.

        >>> solve_linear(x**2*(1/x - z**2/x))
        (x**2*(-x*z**2 + x), x**2)

    You can give a list of what you prefer for x candidates:

        >>> solve_linear(x + y + z, symbols=[y])
        (y, -x - z)

    You can also indicate what variables you don't want to consider:

        >>> solve_linear(x + y + z, exclude=[x, z])
        (y, -x - z)

    If only x was excluded then a solution for y or z might be obtained.

       This may cause situation in which an empty dictionary is returned.
       In this case it means all symbols can be assigned arbitrary values.

       copy of the matrix is made by this routine so the matrix that is
       passed will not be modified.

       The algorithm used here is fraction-free Gaussian elimination,
       which results, after elimination, in an upper-triangular matrix.
       Then solutions are found using back-substitution. This approach
